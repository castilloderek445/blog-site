title: Brief thoughts on the anime I watched from the Winter 2024 season
tags: ["blog"]
---

The first season of the year is over and it was a pretty dang good one. I rarely ever have more seven or eight seasonals to watch, but this time I was watching fifteen (15) different series! The spring season has a lot of sequels to shows I’ve watched so it looks I’ll continue to be kept busy. To mark the end of winter, here are my thoughts on every show I watched.

Sign of Affection

A romance anime featuring university students with a refreshing level of emotional maturity appropriate for their age – a rarity in anime that’s also a bit sobering when you realize the bar is seriously set this low. There were so many times where I expected a character to react in a way typical of most other romance anime, but every time I’m pleasantly surprised to watch them act like realistic people for the most part. The main guy, Itsuomi, seemed a bit too comfortable doing stuff like patting the main girl, Yuki’s, head very early into meeting each other, but I suppose that’s the anime’s shoujo genes showing. The main couple’s development wasn’t bad, but I was more interested in the side characters. Love triangles usually suck dick, but they were my highlight of this show because of how maturely and realistically they go about it, which in turn makes their situations more sympathetic and more enjoyable to watch in a “mine kokoro bleeds for you” kind of way. I respect this anime for giving childhood friends the love and respect they’ve always deserved >:(.

Sasaki to P-chan

This anime was about a middle-aged corporate drone named Sasaki (voiced by my king Sugita) who gets a magical bird from a generic fantasy world, and together they sell real world goods to the fantasy world, which then gets him caught up in that kingdom’s politics. While in the real world, Sasaki accidentally reveals the magical powers taught to him by the bird (who turns out was the most powerful mage in the fantasy world until he got exiled by a corrupt group of nobles) after he saves a woman (who is later to be revealed to be a high schooler for some reason) who is actually part of the Japanese government’s secret esper agency. He gets strong armed into joining said agency, where he and the girl agent run into a group of dangerous magical girls who are much more powerful than most espers and do not operate under any government body, as well as an ambiguously-aged esper girl with a funny antiquated accent. After saving the latter from the former group, Sasaki employs the help of the rogue esper girl and her large information network to flip the gold he earns from his business in the fantasy world into usable money in the real world. Sasaki just wants to silently make his money while living with his cute talking pet bird, but the interaction between the two worlds continues to escalate despite his best efforts. This all happens in the hour-long first episode, and it’s an honestly novel premise. The problem is, managing two separate storylines and have them slowly converge is unwieldy as fuck. I became disinterested in the show’s attempt at political intrigue in the fantasy world, as well as whatever the hell was going on in the real world. Also, about halfway through they decided to change the ED to one of the worst fucking animation sequences I’ve seen in recent memory.

Shin no Nakama S2

I didn’t even like the first season enough to want to watch the sequel, but this show has a meme waifu among my friends and I, so I decided to start this. The slice of life scenes are quite relaxing and the characters are likable and shine in these moments, but the show insists on going through with its painfully mediocre main plot. I seriously could not have cared any less for it. I suppose it is a little admirable for a show to attempt a serious story. It’s just it is such an identity mismatch here. 

Nozomanu Fushi no Boukensha

The anime is about a low level adventurer who stumbles upon a secret chamber in a dungeon and dies alone to an overpowered monster and is inexplicably revived, and he seeks to become stronger while keeping his identity as an undead monster secret. The worldbuilding is decently fleshed out, particularly the adventurer’s guild system. Most shows don’t really delve that deeply into the intricacies of an adventurer as a profession, and this show is a nice take on it. It depicts achieving even bronze class as something that still demands well-rounded experience and intelligence in the field. Also the soundtrack is quite lovely as well.

Solo Leveling

The anime is about a low level adventurer who stumbles upon a secret chamber in a dungeon and dies alone to an overpowered monster and is inexplicably revived, and he seeks to become stronger while keeping his identity as a player of the System secret. It’s done by A-1 Pictures, not much to say other than there are very cool fights. The narrative isn’t very strong,  but for an action anime like this that isn’t too important. Sung Jin-woo’s brand of edginess was kind of bland to me because he isn’t a very interesting personality to begin with, but in the last episode his edginess gained a bit more character to it. 

Bottom-Tier Character Tomozaki-kun S2

The biggest dub I got from this anime was Dialogue+ returning for the OP and ED. How do they do it every time? Other than that, it’s an okay adaptation. As is the case for most adaptations, the LN content is simply more developed. Tama’s arc was well done, but I was a little disappointed in the culture festival arc. In the books, Tomozaki’s had like a million different quests going on at once and the novel did a great job at communicating the grind and build up, which made the finale of the arc very fulfilling. The anime didn’t have enough time to do that and it felt rushed in comparison. I definitely would have been a Mimimi believer if I were anime only. 

Classroom of the Elite S3

Same issues as previous seasons. Novels are just infinitely better. If I hadn’t read the novels beforehand, I would think this series is garbage. There were skipped segments, poor animation, and bad execution of important moments in the story. I’ll still watch every new season. 

Ishura

A bunch of the strongest beings in this fantasy magic world and Earth are summoned and they fight to be crowned the next Hero. There’s also some war between two nations that drives the plot. I like the variety of species featured in the anime – there were humans, skeletons, angels, elves, talking mandrakes, talking wyverns, and other things all competing. I think I enjoyed thinking about the potential fight match-ups more than the actual show. The voice cast is also insanely fucking stacked, good lord. I’ll be ready for the second season. 

Villainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I’m Not the Demon Lord

Girl gets isekai’d into the otome game she plays a lot not as the main heroine but as the secret end-game boss – another addition to villainess subgenre. The title should actually be I May Lack Social Cues but I’m Not the Demon Lord. Yumeilla is funny in a ha ha social autism kind of way. The romance ended up being pretty cute and is the reason why I bumped up my score for it. The last episode had an underwhelming ending, though. 

The Dangers in My Heart S2

This is what dreams are made of. Kyoutarou and Anna not only play off each other really well for that sweet sweet bantz but they each push the other to grow and become closer to their ideal selves. The series does suffer a bit from extending the “will they or won’t they” phase of their relationship a bit long, but every time it’s so incredibly cute I can’t really hate it. It dilutes the impact of each subsequent moment, though only slightly. For as lewd as it can be and the many anime-isms it has, there are numerous that beautifully capture the heart-arching sense of relief that comes from revealing your insecurities to someone who you deeply care for.

Chiyu Mahou no Machigatta Tsukaikata

The main plot isn’t anything noteworthy. This had pretty funny comedy elements, even the slapstick, which carried the rest of the show. The art style and color palette reminds me of anime from the 2000s. Now that I think about it, the entire show feels like something plucked from that era.

 
Kusuriya no Hitorigoto

A very good anime. It features a lot of strong women characters, with of course Maomao being the most impressively written and charming character of the entire show. I enjoyed the unique perspective Maomao offers as someone who has lived in both the brothel and the rear palace. The comparison between the lives and roles the women play in both settings is interestingly explored. But what the hell do I know about women that I can make such a comment like that? Other than that, the visuals are incredibly pretty and are vibrantly colored, the eyes in particular are striking.

Sousou no Frieren

yeah

Moonlit Fantasy S2 (ongoing)

I didn’t remember much of the first season, except for the unexpectedly dark turn in the last episode. Nonetheless, I’m enjoying this new season. It handles a large rotating cast pretty well and the story is slow yet somehow pretty engaging.

Dungeon Meshi (ongoing)

This is my most liked anime that is a non-continuing series this season. Dungeon Meshi has that Trigger style of janky swag with a very appealing hand-drawn art style. Marcille is a reaction face machine. The worldbuilding has a very unique focus on the ecology of the dungeon. The creatures and settings they encounter aren’t inherently unique, but the way the characters interact with them make for some very creative episode-by-episode plotlines. For example, false gold and jewelry from mimic chests are actually insects which the gang fried up for a quick snack. Another really cool example is Laios going inside a bunch of living paintings to try out the food in them. The real people depicted in the paintings were actually moving around and playing out what is depicted in the scene, and Laios could eat the food and feel full. But when he got out of the painting, none of the food he brought came with him and he was no longer full. Dungeon Meshi is shaping up to be a real good anime.
